          <p>For the HTML entry, our winner is Haseeb from Hounslow Library!
          The judges were very impressed with Haseeb’s technical skills,
          including this use of animated bubbles and an embedded YouTube video in his collage.
          Plus they loved the choice of colours, and they felt like we really
          got to know Haseeb’s favourite hobbies.</p>
